  "descr": "[Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) is a People's Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored actor that has been active since at least 2021 primarily targeting critical infrastructure organizations in the US and its territories including Guam. [Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017)'s targeting and pattern of behavior have been assessed as pre-positioning to enable lateral movement to operational technology (OT) assets for potential destructive or disruptive attacks. [Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) has emphasized stealth in operations using web shells, living-off-the-land (LOTL) binaries, hands on keyboard activities, and stolen credentials.(Citation: CISA AA24-038A PRC Critical Infrastructure February 2024)(Citation: Microsoft Volt Typhoon May 2023)(Citation: Joint Cybersecurity Advisory Volt Typhoon June 2023)(Citation: Secureworks BRONZE SILHOUETTE May 2023)",
